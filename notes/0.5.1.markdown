This release is an update to support spray-json 1.2.2. As with all modules of the spray toolkit
the package names have been moved from "cc.spray.json.lenses" to just "spray.json.lenses".

This is planned to be the last release of the standalone json-lenses module. Starting with the next major
release of spray-json, json-lenses will be included in spray-json.
