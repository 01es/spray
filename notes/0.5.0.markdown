This is the initial release of _json-lenses_, a Scala DSL to query and update json data.

Features:

 * Create queries similar to xpath in a native Scala DSL
 * Retrieve selected elements
 * Update selected elements of the immutable spray-json representation
 * Selected elements can be of several cardinalities: scalar values, optional
   values, and sequences of values
 * Experimental support for [json-path][json-path] syntax
