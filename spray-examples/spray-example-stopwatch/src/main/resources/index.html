<h1>spray stopwatch example</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates a somewhat more complex &ldquo;applicaton&rdquo; build with spray.
    It models a number of stopwatches that can be started, stopped, restarted and cleared independently.</p>
<p>Apart from general service building with the spray DSL it shows how to do simple method tunneling
    via a query parameter</p>
