Current Version(s)
==================

Since *spray* heavily depends on Akka_ its releases are usually closely tied to specific Akka versions.


*spray* 0.9.0
-------------

This version targets Scala_ 2.9.x and Akka_ 1.3.x and is considered stable.
Its documentation doesn't live here but in the (old) `github wiki`_.


*spray* 1.0/1.1
---------------

Since the Scala_ universe is currently shifting from Scala_ 2.9.2 to Scala_ 2.10 the next *spray* release will be
a double release, targeting both current Scala_ (and Akka_) versions at the same time.

However, at present *spray* 1.0/1.1 is not quite completed, the current milestone release is *1.0-M3* or *1.1-M3*,
depending on what Scala_/Akka_ version you are targeting.

- *spray 1.0-M3* is built against Scala_ 2.9.2 and Akka_ 2.0.3
- *spray 1.1-M3* is built against Scala_ 2.10-M7 and Akka_ 2.1-M2


For information about where to find the *spray* artifacts please check out the :ref:`maven-repo` chapter.
