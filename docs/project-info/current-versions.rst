Current Version(s)
==================

Since *spray* heavily depends on Akka_ its releases are usually closely tied to specific Akka versions.


*spray* 0.9.0
-------------

This version targets Scala_ 2.9.x and Akka_ 1.3.x and is considered stable.
Its documentation doesn't live here but in the (old) `github wiki`_.


*spray* 1.0/1.1
---------------

Since the Scala_ universe is currently shifting from Scala_ 2.9.2 to Scala_ 2.10 the next *spray* release will be
a double release, targeting both current Scala_ (and Akka_) versions at the same time.

However, at present *spray* 1.0/1.1 is not quite completed, the current milestone release is *1.0-M4* or *1.1-M4*,
depending on what Scala_/Akka_ version you are targeting.
