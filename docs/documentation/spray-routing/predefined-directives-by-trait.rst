Predefined Directives (by trait)
================================

All predefined directives are organized into traits that form one part of the overarching ``Directives`` trait, which
is defined like this:

.. includecode:: /../spray-routing/src/main/scala/spray/routing/Directives.scala
   :snippet: source-quote

You can browse the predefined directives by trait:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   any-param-directives/index
