Predefined Directives
=====================

All predefined directives are organized into traits that form one part of the overarching ``Directives`` trait, which
is defined like this:

.. includecode:: /../spray-routing/src/main/scala/cc/spray/routing/Directives.scala
   :snippet: source-quote

You can browse the predefined directives either by trait:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   basic-directives
   method-directives
   file-and-resource-directives

or alphabetically:

F
-

:ref:`-filter-`
  dfgsdfg

M
-

:ref:`-method-`
  dfgfdg
